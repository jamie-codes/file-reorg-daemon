# file-reorg-daemon
`file-reorg-daemon.py` is a Python script designed to monitor a source directory for new files, reorganize them into a date-based folder structure within a destination directory, and handle errors gracefully by quarantining problematic files. It supports concurrent processing and provides detailed logging and performance metrics.
