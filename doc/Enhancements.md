# File Reorganization Daemon - Production Enhancements

This document provides an overview of the enhancements made to the File Reorganization Daemon script for production readiness, along with the rationale, design decisions, and additional recommendations.

---

## Context and Objective

The File Reorganization Daemon is designed as a **daemon process** that continuously monitors a source directory, detects new files, and moves them to a structured destination folder based on date format. This document outlines the enhancements added to make it resilient, scalable, and production-ready.

The primary production objectives include:
- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Handling high file volumes via concurrent processing.
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling, quarantine for problematic files, and disk space checks.
- **Monitoring and Metrics**: Track metrics for ongoing performance monitoring, logging, and proactive alerting.

---

## Considerations and Assumptions

1. **File Naming Convention**
   - Assumes that files in the source directory follow a consistent **date-based naming pattern** (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_filename`). Files not matching this pattern are ignored.

2. **Processing Environment**
   - This script is expected to run in a **server environment** with ample resources. Environment-specific settings like log level and retry limits can be adjusted through environment variables.

3. **Disk Space Monitoring**
   - Assumes disk space is a critical resource and that insufficient space can disrupt operations. A minimum of 10% free disk space is required to proceed with file processing.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Quarantine Folder for Problematic Files

**Change**:
   - Added a `quarantine_folder` parameter for files that fail processing after reaching the maximum retry limit.

**Rationale**:
   - Prevents problematic files from clogging the main workflow and allows further investigation without affecting ongoing operations.

**Additional Consideration**:
   - Regular checks or alerts for the quarantine folder may be implemented to ensure quarantined files are reviewed.

### 2. Configurable Poll Interval and Retry Attempts

**Change**:
   - `poll_interval` and `max_retries` are configurable, allowing flexibility for different environments (e.g., testing vs. production).

**Rationale**:
   - Enables fine-tuning for different workloads, providing stability and control over retry behavior.

### 3. Disk Space Monitoring

**Change**:
   - Implemented a `check_disk_space` method that requires at least 10% free disk space to start processing files.

**Rationale**:
   - Prevents partial moves or data corruption caused by running out of disk space, ensuring reliable operation.

### 4. Batch Processing with Thread Pool

**Change**:
   - Introduced `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process files concurrently in batches, controlled by `max_workers`.

**Rationale**:
   - Increases throughput and makes the app scalable for higher file volumes.

### 5. Enhanced Logging and Metrics

**Change**:
   - Logging metrics like success/failure counts, average time per file, and error rates for proactive monitoring.

**Rationale**:
   - Enables SLA tracking and alerts for high error rates, assisting in timely issue resolution.

## Additional Resources and Scripts

To support production deployment, consider the following resources:

1. **System Supervisor Configuration**
   - Use a supervisor tool (e.g., `systemd`, `supervisord`) to manage the script, ensuring automatic restart upon failure.

2. **Centralized Logging Setup**
   - Integrate with a centralized logging tool (e.g., ELK stack) for real-time analysis and alerting.

3. **Quarantine Folder Monitoring Script**
   - Set up a periodic check or alert for the quarantine folder to avoid neglected problematic files.

4. **Disk Space Monitoring Script**
   - Consider a background script or cron job for disk usage monitoring, or integrate with `Prometheus` for advanced alerting.

---

## Summary of Rationale for Changes

- **Resilience**: Features like retries, quarantine, and disk space checks make the app more robust.
- **Scalability**: Concurrent batch processing enables efficient handling of large file volumes.
- **Monitoring and SLAs**: Enhanced logging and metrics support SLA compliance and timely alerting for potential issues.

These changes collectively ensure that the application is prepared for production demands with stability, scalability, and proactive monitoring.
